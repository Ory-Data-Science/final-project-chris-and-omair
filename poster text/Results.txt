Based on the data compiled from Medicaid, conclusions were drawn regarding prescribing trends following years in which PDMPs were established in each state. A heatmap is presented which displays how many percentage points each state was off of the national mean by year. The color scheme used ranges from blue to red, with white in the middle. States below the national average become a progressively darker shade of blue while states above the national average become a deeper shade of red. Black boxes indicate years in which no data was acquired for that state. The line graph displays the national mean by year. It can be observed that there is a strong increase in opiate use starting from around the year 2000 upwards. This peaks at 2012 and then finally makes a descent to our current values.

Based on trends starting from the year in which PDMPs were established in each state, approximately 19 states showed a downward trend relative to the national mean. Of those, 6 states presented with a downward trend several years before a PDMP was enacted. 12 states presented with relatively stable trends, with little deviation from their place relative to the national mean. 5 states demonstrated an upwards trend, with PDMPs having little effect on curbing perscribing habits. The data from 13 states was unusable due to PDMP establishment years either too far in the past or too recent. Delaware was an exception due to its very unstable trend. Missouri was excluded due to a lack of PDMP in the state even today.
