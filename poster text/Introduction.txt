Opiod abuse and overprescribing has been a trending topic in the United States for the past several years. With the recent declaration of opioid abuse as a national emergency, the topic has become a greater talking point than ever before. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) has been around for decades, but state governments have recently begun implementing them in greater urgency. Many states have implemented PDMPs within the past decade as a means of monitoring and controlling prescribing practices. The question is, do PDMPs have a pronounced effect on prescribing practices? PDMPs allow pharmacists and prescribers to check if patients have been prescribed controlled substances to prevent concomitant therapy. They also allow the government to observe prescribing habits of providers and initiate corrective measures if needed.  These data-driven interventions theoretically should decrease the number of narcotics prescribed as a percentage of pain-relief therapy, which the following research seeks to verify or disprove.
