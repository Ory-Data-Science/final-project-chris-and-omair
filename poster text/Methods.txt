The statistics program R was used to manipulate data obtained from the Medicaid website. Entire datasets ranging from 1991 to 2017 were analyzed by the R script available on the associated GitHub page (github page reference). Specific drugs were selected as painkillers based on their use for pain relief and as a muscle relaxant. Narcotics were selected based on their function on the opiate pathway specifically. NDC information was obtained from the FDA website and linked to the obtained Medicaid datasets. Narcotic painkiller prescriptions were compared to other painkiller options across years and states. Data regarding years that PDMP systems were implemented were harvested from state specific PDMP and legislature websites.
