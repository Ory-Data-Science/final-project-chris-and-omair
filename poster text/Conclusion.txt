Based upon the Medicaid data from recent years, it seems to be the case that PDMPs are part of a solution, but not the entire cure. In many states that implemented PDMPs, there has been an appreciable downward trend in prescribing habits relative to the nation as a whole. Unfortunately this is not the case in all states. Some states have seen continuing upward trends relative to the national average in narcotic prescribing, which is indicative of a problem that is not improving. While some states remain stable relative to the national average, with the national average decreasing this is still a promising observation. The findings suggest that continuing efforts in monitoring prescribing habits in conjunction with other solutions may curb the rise in narcotic prescriptions and help alleviate the opioid epidemic.
